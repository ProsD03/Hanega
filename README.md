# Hanega: 3DMigoto&Genshin Impact Bootstrapper for Windows
**Hanega** is a utility designed to streamline the setup and launch of *3DMigoto* alongside *Genshin Impact* on Windows. By automating the startup process for these two applications, Hanega saves players from having to manually launch each program individually. Additionally, Hanega manages key system configurations by modifying the Windows Registry, allowing both *3DMigoto* and *Genshin Impact* to run without needing administrator privileges. This prevents disruptive User Account Control (UAC) prompts, offering a smoother and faster launch experience.

The project is developed in Python, leveraging QT for a polished and intuitive user interface, and integrates PySide6 to seamlessly bridge the QT UI with the Python backend.
